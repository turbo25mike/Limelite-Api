                        Digital compasses are calibrated at the factory for accuracy and performance,
                        but need to be recalibrated in the field when used in new locations with different magnetic field properties.
                        Large changes in temperature can also impair the accuracy of the compass.
                        Opening/closing the battery compartment or changing the battery will also require recalibration.

                        Magnetic field of your location could be disturbed.
                        There are many types of terrain in hunting environments.
                        For example, lava rich terrain has a lot of iron and can manipulate the magnetic field around you.

                        When a GPS (your phone) isn't moving, also dependent on your surroundings,
                        you may see your position move around or the accuracy band around your position change.
                        As the GPS believes your position has changed, even with the same distance, inclinometer value, and compass heading,
                        your mapping position would shift based on your location wandering.
                        There are 3 settings in the Configuration screen you can use to improve your location.
                        1) Best - When the GPS identifies the smallest error band, the Leupold Control App will use that position.
                        2) Average - When the GPS is shifting your positional location, it will average all the locations together.
                        3) Static - The Leupold Control App will display your current location and allow you to cut and paste your GPS location
                        from another GPS mapping tool.

                        The RX-5000 calibration process is a new requirement for many users.  Like many things in life,
                        the process becomes easier the more experience you have.  Once the process is understood,
                        the user should expect to reach 100% calibration within 15 seconds.

            <ul class="nested">

                    <p>
                        Long Range Mode functions differently that TBR/W and LOS mode.
                        Where TBR/W and LOS will perform 3 ranges per second, the information collected from these ranges is discarded
                        after a positive range is reached.  Long Range Mode will perform 1 range and continue to acquire laser pulses
                        until a positive target is acquired.  The longer it ranges, the unit has more potential for acquiring a distance.
                        After a target is found, the power button must be released and repressed before acquiring the next target.
                    </p>

            <ul class="nested">
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Long Range Mode will help users range past TBR/W and LOS when etended distances are required.  Long Range Mode will continue to acquire ranges until a distance is reached or the unit times out after 2 minutes.  The unit must remain steady when trying to range these ultra long distances and using the included saddle on a tripod with remote trigger from app is recommended.  Using the rangefinder by hand will allow the user to increase their distances slightly.
                        There is a timeout (in seconds) for remote LONG ranges in the app.  Please set this to the maximum amount of time you would like to wait to acquire a target in Long Range Mode when initiating the ranging from the phone.   This timeout does not apply if you are actually holding the power button down on the rangefinder.
                        If you find that the rangefinder was not steady during the LONG range attempt, please cancel the current attempt and restart it again so the effect of the shake is removed from ranging consideration.
